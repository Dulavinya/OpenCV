# Hand Gesture Detection System (Raspberry Pi)

This project implements a hand gesture detection system using computer vision. The system can detect various hand gestures, including the number of fingers up or down, and recognizable gestures like the peace sign, thumbs up/down, open hand, and the "cool sign".

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using OpenCV.
- Detects finger count (up or down).
- Recognizes gestures such as:
  - Peace sign 
  - Thumbs up / Thumbs down 
  - Open hand 
  - Cool sign 
- Easy to customize and extend with more gestures.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- **Contactless control interfaces** (e.g., volume control, switching slides)  
- **Gesture-based UI** for accessibility tools  
- **Interactive games**  
- **Sign language recognition**  
- **Gesture-controlled robotics**

This system is incredibly useful in situations where touch-free interaction is necessary or more intuitive. For example, in public kiosks or during presentations, users can control interfaces without needing to touch a deviceâ€”reducing physical contact and improving hygiene. Itâ€™s also beneficial for people with mobility impairments, enabling hands-free or simplified input methods. Moreover, the system can be integrated into robotics or AR/VR applications for natural gesture-based commands, making user interaction more immersive and efficient.
