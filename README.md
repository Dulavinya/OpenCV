# Hand Gesture Detection System (Raspberry Pi)

This project implements a hand gesture detection system using computer vision. The system can detect various hand gestures, including the number of fingers up or down, and recognizable gestures like the peace sign, thumbs up/down, open hand, and the "cool sign".

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using OpenCV.
- Detects finger count (up or down).
- Recognizes gestures such as:
  - Peace sign 
  - Thumbs up / Thumbs down 
  - Open hand 
  - Cool sign 
- Easy to customize and extend with more gestures.

## üí° Use Cases

- **Contactless control interfaces** (e.g., volume control, switching slides)  
- **Gesture-based UI** for accessibility tools  
- **Interactive games**  
- **Sign language recognition**  
- **Gesture-controlled robotics**

This gesture detection system offers a practical and intuitive solution for real-world interaction with technology. By recognizing not just the number of fingers held up but also symbolic gestures like thumbs up/down, peace, and the ‚Äúcool‚Äù sign, it enables a wide range of applications‚Äîfrom hands-free device control to gesture-based commands in robotics or smart environments. Whether for enhancing accessibility, enabling contactless control in hygiene-sensitive settings, or creating immersive experiences in AR/VR or gaming, this system brings a powerful layer of natural human-computer interaction.
